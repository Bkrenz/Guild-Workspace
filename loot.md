# Mist Loot Policy Changes

As Mist has grown and achieved success over the last two expansions, we want to ensure that we are holding true to our core tenet that the Team Comes First.
This extends to everything we do as a guild, from running Mythic+ Dungeons to recruitment of new members to distribution of loot inside raids.
With the advancement of tooling outside of raids, Mist is adopting methods and processes to include analytic data into our Loot Policy.

Those of you who have raided with us before have seen our ideas and management of Loot grow and change.
From a simple Loot Council, to the first incarnation of our Mist Bot, to the growing adoption of WoWAudit, we aim to use these tools to fuel a team first approach to Loot that is fair.
Utilizing these tools, we hope to make Loot distribution both more optimal and more transparent.

WoWAudit has recently added two crucial features to their offerings that we will be utilizing frequently, at first on a test basis.
First, WoWAudit has published a new AddOn for RCLootCouncil that brings your Droptimizer Wishlists ingame.
When selecting a response for items, the expected value of that upgrade will appear alongside.
Secondly, they now have an automated client to parse and aggregate RCLootCouncil historical data.
This gives us an easy interface to observe how Loot has been distributed historically.

> So how does this affect you, our raiders?

You will continue to submit your Droptimizers as you have in the past.
Please reference the published settings for Droptimizer settings, and any errors in yours will be reported by the Bot in your DMs.
The WoWAudit AddOn is currently available through the [Wago App](https://addons.wago.io/app) and Curseforge.
This AddOn is what shows your Droptimizer Wishlist data in-game, and will be *required*.
Data will be automatically synced to you via the Raid Leader in game, as long as your character's data is available on WoWAudit.

> How does this affect our Loot decisions?

The Loot Council's loot distribution will be based around the following criteria:

- Droptimizer Wishlist values
- Historical loot acquisition
- Effort outside of Raid (M+, Delves, etc)
- Final Boss Roster Optimizations

How do all of those fit together?
We are looking to make sure items are given in a way that propels the team forward best.
We primarily look at the Value of the items, to ensure that they are given where the impact will be most felt.
This should also be a generally fair process, and sometimes players that put in the most effort in M+ will show the lowest Values for upgrades in raids.
As such, your effort outside of raid will also be weighted when determining loot distribution.

> What about Tier Tokens and Sets?

Tier Tokens are the most contested early on, and as such their distribution will sometimes not follow Wishlist Droptimizer values.
In the case of Tier, we do prioritize completing 4-Set and 2-Set bonuses wherever possible.
It's recommended to hold your early Vaults when Tier is present, so that we can utilize that information for distribution Tier Tokens.
We do expect most players to have Tier Sets completed early on.
Do remember that everyone gets access to Catalyst during Mythic Week 1, as well as the token from AotC/KSM/etc.
We are working on gaining access to how impactful Tier Sets are, which we try to utilize as additional information.

> Inquiries, Complains, Comments

As always, please feel free to make inquiries when you don't understand the decision that has been made.
I am always open to discussions, and would love to understand your point of view.
Valid complaint is something like: "I haven't gotten loot because Cuppie has me on ignore."
Just don't come to me with, "My fee-fee are hurt" you snowflakes.

> TLDR

Install the new Addon, do your Droptimizers.
